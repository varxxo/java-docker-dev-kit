Application Architecture:
```
├── App
│   └── Index (Main Page)
│       └── Card
│           ├── CardHeader
│           │   └── Title
│           ├── CardContent
│           │   ├── TaskInput
│           │   └── TaskList

│           └── CardFooter
│               └── Statistics
```

Component Hierarchy and Data Flow:
```
Index (State Management)
├── Task State [tasks[], setTasks()]
├── New Task State [newTask, setNewTask()]
└── UI Components
    ├── Input → Add Task → Update Tasks State
    ├── Task List → Read Tasks State
    └── Footer → Calculate Statistics from Tasks State
```

## Algorithms
1. Task Addition (O(1)):
```typescript
const addTask = () => {
  const task = {
    id: Date.now(),
    text: newTask,
    completed: false
  };
  setTasks([...tasks, task]);
};
```

2. Task Deletion (O(n)):
```typescript
const deleteTask = (id: number) => {
  setTasks(tasks.filter((task) => task.id !== id));
};
```

3. Task Completion Toggle (O(n)):
```typescript
const toggleTask = (id: number) => {
  setTasks(tasks.map((task) =>
    task.id === id ? { ...task, completed: !task.completed } : task
  ));
};
```

## Research questions and responses
1. **How does React's state management compare to other frameworks for this use case?**
   React's useState hook provided sufficient state management for this application's scope. The built-in state management proved adequate for handling task operations and UI updates. While larger applications might benefit from Context API or Redux, the current implementation demonstrates that simple state management can be effective for focused applications.

2. **What are the performance implications of using TailwindCSS versus traditional CSS?**
   TailwindCSS provided faster development speed through its utility-first approach. While the initial bundle size was slightly larger, production optimization through PurgeCSS eliminated unused styles. The developer experience benefits outweighed the minimal performance impact, and the resulting CSS was highly maintainable.

3. **How does TypeScript improve code quality and development experience?**
   TypeScript significantly enhanced code quality through:
   - Early error detection during development
   - Improved IDE support with intelligent code completion
   - Clear interface definitions for component props
   - Better refactoring capabilities
   - Reduced runtime errors through type checking
   The Task interface definition ensured consistent data structure throughout the application.

4. **What are the benefits and challenges of using shadcn/ui components?**
   Benefits:
   - Consistent design language
   - Accessible components out of the box
   - Customizable through Tailwind
   - Regular updates and improvements
   
   Challenges:
   - Learning curve for component APIs
   - Balancing customization with consistency
   - Managing component dependencies

5. **How effective is the current state management approach for future scalability?**
   The current approach using React's useState is effective for the current scope but may need enhancement for scaling:
   - Current benefits: Simple, easy to understand, sufficient for current needs
   - Future considerations: May need Context API or Redux for complex state management
   - Potential improvements: Implementation of custom hooks for specific functionality
